Project task: Create a landing page similar to the provided example. (Link to example: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)

Learning goal: Understanding the box model and using flex boxes.

Reflection/Outcome: 
-Instead of following the example pixel by pixel, I attempted to give it my own spin by creating a landing page for an imaginary lodging platform.
-Font, color palette and images were individually selected by me to fit the concept I was going for.
